# Template Inheritance

Another thing that bugs you about Emily's webdev work is that her website still looks like it came out right after the birth of the Internet, like the old [SpaceJam](https://spacejam.com/) website. You know just how much better webpages with **Bootstrap** look, so you're planning to make her site look much better. Hopefully she doesn't get mad about the redesign and take back all those dog costumes you've more than earned (although a gift card to Applebee's would have been *so* much better).

## Instructions

**Read everything before you start!**

(Before you start, you can copy your files from the last lab once you've already solved it.)

Now that you have template inheritance working in Emily's app, your next task is to improve the look of the pages with Bootstrap.

**Remember to create and use a separate Python virtual environment for each lab.** You'll be glad you did. :)

### Task: Bootstrapping the Project

Only after step 1 will you be ready for step 2, which is to add Flask-Bootstrap to the project to improve the look of the pages. Keep the original `style.css` in as it defines CSS classes that are used in the templates.

Once you see that the pages have Bootstrap styles, replace the `<header>` tags with a fancy Bootstrap navigation bar. See the course page on Flask-Bootstrap for the HTML structure for the navbar.

In short, for this step, all you are required to do is:

- add Flask-Bootstrap
- replace the header with a navigation bar
